You are given a bunch of unsorted integers. Your task is to find all pairs of number that have the smallest difference between them. Then output them in ascending order.

First line contain single integer N, representing the number of integers available.
The next line contains N integer I separated by space. These are the number that you have to process.

Output all pairs of integer with the smallest difference between them.
If there is multiple pairs with same smallest differece, print them all in ascending order.
Give a single space separating each numbers.
If there is a number that lies in two pairs, print it two times.

2 <= N <= 200.000
-10^7 <= I <= 10^7
Ii != Ij where 1 <= i < j <= N

Sample input : 
5
10 3 4 30 40

Sample output : 
3 4

Sample input :
3
1 2 3

Sample output : 
1 2 2 3
