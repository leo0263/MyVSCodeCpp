Create a Search Engine Crawler! Where one thread of the engine crawl for new strings discoveries, another thread is standing by for search query.

This core of this search engine must be able to do these two query : 
1. add "string" : store the string to the engine data corpus (library)
2. find "string" : where the string is a prefix, the engine must return the number of available data in the library matching this prefix

You have to create an engine thats able to process a sequential queries and respond properly without fail!

The first line contains a single integer N, denoting the number of queries to be processed sequentially.
The next N line contains a single query in the form of an integer [code] followed by a [string].
    If the preceding int is 0 then the query is add "string"
    If the preceding int is 1 then the query is find "string"

1 <= n <= 10^5
1 <= |string| <= 21
It is guaranteed that the "string" contains lowercase, one word, english letter only
It is guaranteed that there is no duplicate "string" for [add] queries

For each query, find out how many [data] in the current library that is starting with the [prefix] string
