Imagine yourself as a Celestial beings, wielding an Overwhelming Powers. Out of your boredoom you decide to illuminate the universe! You do this by picking a pair of the least bright stars, placing both of them between your palm, then swiftly smash them together into a brighter star. You will keep doing this until the universe is bright enough to your satisfaction.

A combined star will have a new brightness level according to this formula : 

brightness = (1 * least bright star) + (2 * 2nd least bright star)

You will repeat the smashing stars until all the remaining stars have a brightness >= B

Given the exact initial number of stars before you start smashing, findout how many smash required to create a >= B star-filled universe!




Input -----

The 1st line consist of two integer N and K separated by space. 
N is the initial number of stars in the universe.
B is is the minimum brightness of any stars befor you are satisfied.
The next N lines contain a single integer I denoting the initial brighness of every stars in the universe.




Constraints -----

1 <= N <= 10^6
0 <= B <= 10^9
0 <= I <= 10^6



Output -----

Print the number of smashing you'd have to increase the brighness of every remaining stars to >= B.
Print -1 if it's impossible to illuminate the sky to your satisfaction.





Sample Input -----

5 10
1 2 3 2 1



Sample Output -----

4



Explanation ------

At the beginning, you will have to smash the 1 & 1 stars, two of the least bright stars.
This yield : (1 x 1) + (2 x 1) = 3

The remaining stars are : 2 3 2 3 <- the last star is the result of 1 & 1 stars combined

Next you smash 2 & 2 : (1 x 2) + (2 x 2) = 5
Now you have : 3 3 5
Next you smash 3 & 3 = 9
Now you have : 5 9
Next you smash 5 & 9 = 23
Now you have only 1 star with 23 brighness, which satisfy your likeness.

And you only smash the stars 4 times before it happens.
